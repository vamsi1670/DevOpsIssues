I have configured jenkins Master in windows server and slave as well.Now all the builds are running in slave machine.But after the build is successful
I can see the workspace only in slave machine where as builds are seen in master server only.
I wanted to know how to change all the logs and builds to slave machine.

Workaround:
I have changed "config.xml " file in this line ${item_rootdir}/builds changed to slave machine folder.No builds are shown after running the job.
Can you please suggest the solution.
